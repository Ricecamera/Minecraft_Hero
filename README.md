# STEVE-VS-ZOMBIES

Steve wakes up in nowhere and discovers that everyone has already become a zombie. Can he survive and get out of this place?

Your task is to use any weapon available at your disposal to survive the endless wave of zombies at long as possible. The longer you survive, the higher score you get. Although steve woke up in nowhere, he is not alone. There is the mysterious friend who intermittently gives him an airdrop that contains an item that can help him in the survival.

This game is inspired by one of my childhood favorite flash game "Blockhead" you can play the game at https://ricecamera.itch.io/steve-vs-zombies.
